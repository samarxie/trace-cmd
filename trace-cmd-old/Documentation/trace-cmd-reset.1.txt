TRACE-CMD-RESET(1)
==================

NAME
----
trace-cmd-reset - turn off all Ftrace tracing to bring back full performance

SYNOPSIS
--------
*trace-cmd reset* ['OPTIONS']

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The trace-cmd(1) reset command turns off all tracing of Ftrace. This will
bring back the performance of the system before tracing was enabled. This is
necessary since 'trace-cmd-record(1)', 'trace-cmd-stop(1)' and
'trace-cmd-extract(1)' do not disable the tracer, event after the data has
been pulled from the buffers. The rational is that the user may want to
manually enable the tracer with the Ftrace pseudo file system, or examine other
parts of Ftrace to see what trace-cmd did. After the reset command happens,
the data in the ring buffer, and the options that were used are all lost.

OPTIONS
-------
*-b* 'buffer_size'::
    When the kernel boots, the Ftrace ring buffer is of a minimal size (3
    pages per CPU). The first time the tracer is used, the ring buffer size
    expands to what it was set for (default 1.4 Megs per CPU).

    If no more tracing is to be done, this option allows you to shrink the
    ring buffer down to free up available memory.

    trace-cmd reset -b 1
